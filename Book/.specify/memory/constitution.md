## Vision

To be the most accessible and practical guide for beginners and intermediate learners to get started with Physical AI. The book will focus on hands-on learning, empowering readers to build their own intelligent systems that interact with the physical world.

## Core Principles

### I. Beginner-Friendly
Content must be created with beginners in mind. Complex topics should be broken down into simple, easy-to-understand concepts. All acronyms and jargon must be clearly defined.

### II. Hands-On Learning
The book is built around practical, hands-on projects. Each chapter should include at least one project that readers can build themselves. The source code for all projects must be available and well-documented.

### III. Practical Applications
Focus on real-world applications of Physical AI. The projects should be meaningful and demonstrate the power and potential of Physical AI.

### IV. Docusaurus for Documentation
The online version of the book will be built using Docusaurus. This ensures a consistent and high-quality reading experience, with features like search, versioning, and easy navigation.
